# CPP-Sketchpads

This is a collection of C++ project/sketchpads.<br/>
Here you will find most of the code that I create for tutorial purposes.<br/>
Each sketchpad revolves around a different topic.<br/>
Some sketchpads are centered around fundamental C++ concepts.<br/>
Other sketchpads are centered around DSP, data structures, or algorithms.<br/>
Feel free to browse and comment on the code or make suggestions for further improvement.<br/>
I want to make sure that the code is highly readable and understandable before using fancy C++ features.<br/>
These are meant to be learning/tutorial tools.<br/>

I have written articles that correspond with some of these files.<br/>
