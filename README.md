# CPP-Sketchpads

This is a collection of C++ project/sketchpads.
Here you will find most of the code that I create for tutorial purposes.
Each sketchpad revolves around a different topic.
Some sketchpads are centered around fundamental C++ concepts.
Other sketchpads are centered around DSP, data structures, or algorithms.
Feel free to browse and comment on the code or make suggestions for further improvement.
I want to make sure that the code is highly readable and understandable before using fancy C++ features.
These are meant to be learning/tutorial tools.
